 Project Title: [Your Project Name Here]📝
 1. Overview and DescriptionThis section is the elevator pitch for your project. Be clear, compelling, and state the core purpose.This project, [Project Name], is a [Type of Application, e.g., command-line utility, web service, data analysis tool] developed in Python. Its primary goal is to [State the main function and value, e.g., simplify personal financial tracking by providing persistent storage and a navigable interface].The application is designed to be user-friendly, lightweight, and platform-independent, making it easy for users to manage their daily [relevant domain, e.g., contacts, finances, or calculations] directly from their terminal.
 2.  2. Key Features and FunctionalityDetail the specific capabilities that your program offers.Data Persistence: All user input (contacts/expenses/etc.) is automatically saved to a local file (contacts.txt or data.json) and reloaded upon restart, ensuring no data loss.Interactive Command Menu: The program provides a clear, numbered menu system for easy navigation between tasks (e.g., Add, View, Search, Exit).Modular Architecture: Code is organized into dedicated functions (load_data(), add_record(), view_summary()) for improved readability and maintainability.Robust Input Validation: Includes basic error handling to prevent crashes from non-numeric or unexpected inputs.Specific Feature Example: For the Budget Tracker, mention: Automatic calculation of the remaining balance after deducting expenses from total income.
3. Getting StartedThis is the essential section for new users, detailing the environment setup.3.1. PrerequisitesEnsure the user knows exactly what they need installed.Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux.Python: Version 3.6 or higher. You can verify your installation by running:Bashpython --version
Environment Manager (Recommended): Use a virtual environment (like venv or conda) to manage dependencies separately from your system Python installation.3.2. InstallationDetailed steps for setting up the project locally.Clone the Repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project-name.git
cd your-project-name
Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:Bashpython -m venv venv
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
Install Required Libraries:If your project uses any external packages (e.g., pandas, requests, sqlalchemy), list them in a requirements.txt file and install them here.Bashpip install -r requirements.txt
3.3. ExecutionHow to run the application after setup.Simply run the main script from the activated virtual environment:Bashpython main_app.py
 4. Usage GuideWalk the user through the application's flow.Initial Run: Upon first execution, the program will create the necessary data file (e.g., contacts.txt or budget.json) in the current directory.Menu Navigation: Use the keyboard to enter the corresponding number for the desired action.1: Add New Record2: View All Data3: Search/Query Data4: ExitData Input: The application will prompt you step-by-step for required information (e.g., Name, Phone, Email, or Amount, Category). Follow the instructions carefully.Exiting: Always use the dedicated Exit option ([4]) to ensure all recent changes are properly saved to the persistent file before closing the terminal. 5. Troubleshooting and FAQAnticipate common problems users might encounter.IssuePotential CauseSolution"ModuleNotFoundError"Required libraries were not installed.Ensure you ran pip install -r requirements.txt while your virtual environment was active.Data not savingThe application was closed abruptly (e.g., closing the terminal window).Always exit via the menu option [4] Exit to trigger the final save function.'python' command not foundPython executable is not in the system PATH.Ensure Python 3 is installed correctly, or try running with python3 main_app.py. 6. Contribution GuidelinesDetailed steps for developers interested in contributing code.Forking: Fork the repository on GitHub.Branching: Create a new branch for your feature or fix. Use descriptive names (e.g., feat/add-json-support, fix/zero-division-error).Bashgit checkout -b your-contribution-branch
Development: Write clean, well-documented code. Please follow the [mention coding standard, e.g., PEP 8] style guide.Testing: Ensure your new code does not break existing functionality. Run any included tests or manually verify the main application functions.Commit: Commit your changes with a clear and concise message.Bashgit commit -m "feat: Briefly describe the new feature or fix"
Pull Request: Push your branch to your fork and submit a Pull Request to the main repository's main branch. 7. LicenseThis project is distributed under the MIT License. See the LICENSE file for more information. 8. Contact and SupportCreator: [GAURAV GUPTA] REG NO-25BSA10080
